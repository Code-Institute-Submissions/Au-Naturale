## Issues and Resolutions

I expericned the following issues,
- my boilerplate that i got from th cdn website did not work so all my bootstraps code were non- repsponsive. so when i started building it caused a lot of issues for me as i did not notice this earlier.This was fixed when i changed boilerplates.
- I had an overflow issues because i had set all my images wdith above 300px including the width of my logo. 
 This was solved by setting all my width to 100% .
- wanted to insert a crossfading image in my jumbtron, however that did not work well, because my selcted images were not of a similar size.
 This was resolved by removing one image. 
 - issues with my form, especially the drop down option as it would not align with rest f the form.
 - issues also with my the size of my fonts being inconsistnce on different device screen sizes.
  Set @media break to make it more repsonsive by increasing the size for different widths.

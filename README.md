### Issues and Resolutions

I experienced the following issues,
-My boilerplate that I got from the CDN website did not work which made my bootstrap component unresponsive.  when I started building it caused a lot of issues. This was fixed when I changed boilerplates.
- Experienced Overflow issues that were due to setting all my images width above 300px including my logo. 
  This was solved by setting the widths to 100%,with the help of the tutors. 
 -I wanted to insert a crossfading image in my jumbotron, this did not work because my selected images were not similar in size. This was resolved by removing one of the images and crossfade altogether.
 - The next selected image for ther jumbotron did not go with my layout plan so i changed the image and moved the image to the background of my jumbotron.
 - My appointment form drop-down option would not align. I changed the layout of my form to  make everything align 
 - My paragraph was not lined up to my pictures in the about us feature. 
 Set @media break to mak
 - When i added the background image in my services feature, the texts could not be seen so, i had to add a an overlay and the the font color.
